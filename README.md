# **Election Analysis**
Module 3 Python

### **Project Overview**
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent congressional election.
I was tasked to complete,
  1.) Calculate the total number of votes.
  2.) Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
  3.) Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
  4.) Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
  5.) Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
  
  ### **Resources**
  
    * Data Source: election_results.csv
    * Software: Python 3.9.5, Visual Studio Code, 1.57.1

### **Summary**

* There were 369,711 total votes cast in the election.
* *The candidates were:*
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doane

* *The candidate results were:*
  - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote. Receiving 85,213 votes
  - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote. Receiving 272,892 votes
  - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote.  Receiving 11,606 votes
* *The winner of the election was:
  - Diana Degette, who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes.
  
### **Challenge Overview**
 The challenge asked to have the counties that participated in the vote included the totals.
 * *The counties were:*
 
    -Arapahoe
    
    -Denver
    
   -Jefferson
 
 * *The county results were:*
 
   -Arapahoe county recorded 24,801 votes which made up 6.7% of the total vote.
   
   -Denver county recorded 306,055 votes which made up 73.8% of the total vote.
   
   -Jefferson county recorded 38,855 votes which made up 10.5% of the total vote.
  
 ### **Challenge Summary**
 Thanks to the overwhelming turnout by Denver County, Diana DeGette was able to defeat her opponents handly.  The two other counties did not even factor in the election as even if all of their cast votes went to one opponent, it wouldn't have been enough to overcome the results out of Denver county.
